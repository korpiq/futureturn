==========

Board game about populating a terraformed planet to find a way to return to space.

Rough rule ideas have been drafted in Finnish at:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fnCry1-6ypIOs53V9QRotI7ojz62lgj1UXl4a_meS08/edit

Here in this distributed version control thingy we develop a computer simulation
of the game in order to try and find out what works and what does not.

An immediately playable web page is available here at source/js/index.html
and sometimes updated at http://kato.iki.fi/hexmap/

We may also choose to write our rules here in some simple syntax. Time may tell.

We may as well end up just abandoning this project just like so many.
